## Reading Material

Read through the examples in these two articles about [`for` loops](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-construct-for-loops-in-python-3) and [`while` loops](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-construct-while-loops-in-python-3) from Digital Ocean. Then, answer the following questions.

1. What is a nested loop? 

--- A loop that occurs within another loop


2. Which kind of loop is based on a conditional statement: `while` loops or `for` loops?

--- while loop


3. When you want to iterate a specific number of times, would you typically use a `while` loop or a `for` loop?

--- for loop


4. Is it possible to loop through a string one letter at a time? What is the example given in the article?

--- Yes, example given in article used for loop to loop through the string "Sammy"


5. Extrapolate from what you learned in the articles: Do you think a `for` loop be nested inside a `while` loop? Why or why not?

--- Yes, the for loop can be leveraged in a while loop when looking to write additional condition through each iteration within the while loop
